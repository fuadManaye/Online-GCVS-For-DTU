# Online-GCVS-For-DTU (  Online Graduate Credential Verification System For Debretabor University)
- The system I developed is an online graduate credential verification system for Debretabor University. 
  This system is a system that helps students to take their education and certificates wherever they are.also, 
  this system is very useful for organizations. This is a system that facilitates the way that the company can call 
  the students who it thinks are the best students to  work there, using this system.
  
# How to Use/Run this project

step 1: downlod and extract the file

step 2: move the file in your wamp folder (C:\wamp64\www)

step 3: import the database named "Graduation DB"

step 4: run and use the system 

NB: In the student folder there are two files AGENCYR.TTF and BRUSHSCI.TTF, Therefore, the location I saved is not for you, so you will have to adjust the location of the two files view_certificate.php and view_credential.php.
