# Online-GCVS-For-DTU (  Online Graduate Credential Verification System For Debretabor University)
- The system I developed is Online graduate credential verification system for Debretabor University. This
  system is designed to computerize the process of adding student information and taking the
  certificate records considering the problems faced by doing this manually. This system has enables   
  us to perform give certificate and credential to Debretabor University students.
  
# How to Use/Run this project

step 1: downlod and extract the file

step 2: move the file in your wamp folder (C:\wamp64\www)

step 3: import the database named "Graduation DB"

step 4: run and use the system 

NB: In the student folder there are two files AGENCYR.TTF and BRUSHSCI.TTF, Therefore, the location I saved is not for you, so you will have to adjust the location of the two files view_certificate.php and view_credential.php.
